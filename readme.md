# Image Caption Django Project

This Django project serves a crucial purpose in the field of computer vision and natural language processing by converting images to captions. It employs an encoder-decoder model with carefully selected checkpoints:

- Encoder Checkpoint: "nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning"
- Decoder Checkpoint: "nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning"
- Model Checkpoint: "nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning"
